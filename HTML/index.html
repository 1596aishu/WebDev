<h4>Life is like a roller coaster; full of twists and turns, ups and downs, and full of surprises. But when lifeâ€™s journey is smooth, life is beautiful.</h4>
<p>MSIT is a course which helps us explore and truely understand ourselves. It has a totally different kind of curriculum allowing students to experience their talents with hands-on activities.
This is not only a good opportunity for freshers but it also helps experienced people with gaining different technological knowledge with really working on them.
After working for a year as a developer, I wanted to explore more and improvise my technical skills.
When I began my MSIT journey here, I was excited to learn but I was told about how it would be a long schedule with stress and anxiety. After I became used to this, I learnt many new technologies and brushed my previous knowledge.
MSIT also helps us with softskills like communication, pressure dealing situations, time management and most importantly interview facing skills.
I almost completed my first year here at MSIT and I can proudly say that I've learnt a lot and will continue learning.
